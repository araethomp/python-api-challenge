# python-api-challenge

As part of an API assignment, we were asked to address the question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"  This repository contains two main files, "VacationPy" and "WeatherPy", as well as an output folder that has code and image files that were created by the main files.  This code was created using Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook.
